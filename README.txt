Game Rules:

To play the game, choose the game mode as prompted by the text interface.
The ball you are launching is highlighted yellow.
You click on the part of the screen you want to aim at.
The further away you click from the ball, the more powerful the launch.
You get one click per ball, and the turn starts once the final selection has been made.
The game runs until either player wins or there is a tie.

Bugs and Things to Note:

The game will likely not work on Python 3.8. Make sure to use the latest version.
The game will not work in Spyder.
The simulation will sometimes run at a noticeably faster rate when there are fewer balls in play. The physics is unaffected.
